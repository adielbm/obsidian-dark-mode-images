# Dark Mode SVG Filter

An Obsidian plugin that automatically applies a hue-preserving invert filter to SVG images in dark mode for better visibility. This ensures that SVG graphics remain clearly visible and properly contrasted when switching between light and dark themes.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Automatically applies SVG filter to images in dark mode
- ðŸŒˆ Preserves original hues while inverting luminance
- âš¡ Zero configuration required - works immediately after installation
- ðŸ”„ Seamlessly toggles with theme changes
- ðŸ“± Works on both desktop and mobile versions of Obsidian

## How It Works

Previously, simple CSS invert filters like `filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);` were used, but these made some colors look weird. (see: [Forum Discussion](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/looking-for-the-perfect-color-inversion-css-for-embedded-excalidraw-drawing/73123) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58402100/13713934))

This plugin uses a better approach based on [this solution](https://monochrome.sutic.nu/2024/02/25/hue-preserving-invert-css-filter-for-dark-mode.html) that preserves hues while inverting luminance.

The plugin:
1. Injects an SVG filter `<filter id="invert-luminance" color-interpolation-filters="linearRGB">` into the DOM
2. Applies `filter: url(#invert-luminance);` to all SVG images when in dark mode
3. Automatically removes the filter in light mode
